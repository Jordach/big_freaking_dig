If a feature is just a normal minetest_game based mod, then make a pull request, it will get pulled, and will be modified to work with this game.

If a .lua file is being worked on lots, you'll know that it will be finished by the end of the day.

Keep in mind that pull requests may get ignored as mail is not often checked.
